# Truck Check Scheduler

A javascript-based application used directly in google sheets to help coordinate the fire department with the biweekly 
checking of firetrucks, ladder trucks, brush trucks, heavy rescue trucks, special rescue trucks, and other fire related
apparatus to ensure that all the tools are present and operational.

Features include selecting a month and year, and creating a schedule for the month, which is based upon things such as the
number of mondays in the month and the previous months schedule. Anothe feature is the ability to randomize the schedule in
an already created schedule.
